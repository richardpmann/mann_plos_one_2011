SPP inference toolbox: Richard Mann (2011)

This toolbox contains the code necessary to reproduce the results in the paper: Bayesian inference for identifying interaction rules in moving animal groups.

Basic usage:

P = sppABC(L,N,R,velocity,t,a,b,c,E, ba, p, plot_flag); 
%Runs a simulation of the SPP model. Code can be modified to run either a geometrical or topological model by selecting the apprpriate neighbourhood function
%Either: nhBlind3x.m for geometrical or nhTopoBlind3x.m for topological.
%See function description for details of parameter values.

---------------

logP = logP_sppABC_{euclid, topo}(P,L,R,a,b,c,E, ba, p);
%Gives the log probability of the data, P, given a particular set of parameter values for either the geometrical (euclid) or topological (topo) model

---------------

logP = logP_scan(P, L, R, A, B, C, E, BA, Q); or logP = logP_scan_topo(P, L, K, A, B, C, E, BA, Q);
%Scans the parameter space defined by the vectors of possible parameter values and calculates the probability of the data P for each parameter set. 

---------------

results_script; %A script showing how the results in the paper were generated. Previously generated results are in the results directory.

---------------

make_figures_multipanel; %A script to take the results from the script above and make appropriate figures. By default this will use the pre-generated results in the results directory.

NB: Because the results files are very large (~ 2GB), these will be provided on demand
Please contact rmann@math.uu.se if you wish to receive these.

./results directory: contains several pre-generated result files:

HUGEBENCHMARK_withBgen: contains results generated from geometrical simulations including an alignment term
HUGEBENCHMARK_withoutBgen: contains results generated from geometrical simulations excluding an alignment term
HUGEBENCHMARK_withBtopo: contains results generated from topological simulations including an alignment term
HUGEBENCHMARK_Qfree: contains results from generated from geometrical simulations with alignment term allowing inferred value of update rate
